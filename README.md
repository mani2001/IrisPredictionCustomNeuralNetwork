# IrisPredictionCustomNeuralNetwork
Simple Iris prediction (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) as part of reading the book - Statquest Neural Networks


Used a simple 2 layer neural network, built from scratch using Pytorch to classify between different Iris types. Did this as part of reading the book - Statquest Guide to Neural Networks
